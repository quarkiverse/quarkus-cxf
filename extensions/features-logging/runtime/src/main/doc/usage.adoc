This extension wraps the CXF `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-features-logging` artifact
thus providing the `org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature` class.

`LoggingFeature` instances can be configured per service or per client.
You can either use a `LoggingFeature` instance with default settings
or you can produce a custom `LoggingFeature` CDI bean.

=== Attaching `LoggingFeature` to a client or service

You have two options to do that:

1. In `application.properties`:
+
[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
# For a service:
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/hello".features=org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature
# For a client:
quarkus.cxf.client."myClient".features=org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature
----
+
TIP: There is an example in xref:user-guide/first-soap-web-service.adoc#logging-feature[Your first SOAP Web service] chapter of the User guide.
+
or alternatively
+
2. Use the `@Features` annotation of CXF:
+
[source,java]
----
@org.apache.cxf.feature.Features (features = {"org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature"})
@WebService(endpointInterface = "org.acme.SayHi", targetNamespace = "uri:org.acme")
public class SayHiImplementation implements SayHi {
   public long sayHi(long arg) {
       return arg;
   }
   //...
}
----

=== Custom `LoggingFeature`

`LoggingFeature` offers some attributes that may be worth customizing in some situations.

E.g. if your payloads are complex, you may want to set `prettyLogging` to `true` to render them with an indentation.
Or if your messages are big and you need to see them complete in the log, you may want to increase the `limit`.

TIP: Check the CXF https://cxf.apache.org/docs/message-logging.html[message logging] page for all possible `LoggingFeature` attributes.

To achieve this, you can produce a custom `LoggingFeature` bean that is then picked by Quarkus CXF
for clients and services where you specified `*.features = org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature`:

[source,java,subs="attributes"]
----
import org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature;
import {javaxOrJakartaPackagePrefix}.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import {javaxOrJakartaPackagePrefix}.enterprise.inject.Produces;

class Producers {

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    LoggingFeature loggingFeature() {
        LoggingFeature loggingFeature = new LoggingFeature();
        loggingFeature.setPrettyLogging(true);
        loggingFeature.setLimit(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        return loggingFeature;
    }
}
----

=== Multiple custom ``LoggingFeature``s

In case you'd like to configure the ``LoggingFeature``s for your individual services or clients differently,
you can so that by defining multiple `@Named` `LoggingFeature` beans:

[source,java,subs="attributes"]
----
import org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature;
import {javaxOrJakartaPackagePrefix}.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import {javaxOrJakartaPackagePrefix}.enterprise.inject.Produces;

class Producers {

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    @Named("limitedLoggingFeature") // "limitedLoggingFeature" is redundant if the name of the method is the same
    LoggingFeature limitedLoggingFeature() {
        LoggingFeature loggingFeature = new LoggingFeature();
        loggingFeature.setLimit(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        return loggingFeature;
    }

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    @Named("prettyLoggingFeature")
    LoggingFeature prettyLoggingFeature() {
        LoggingFeature loggingFeature = new LoggingFeature();
        loggingFeature.setPrettyLogging(true);
        return loggingFeature;
    }
}
----

and then refer to them by their names prefixed with `#` in `application.properties`:

[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
# For a service:
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/hello".features = #limitedLoggingFeature
# For a client:
quarkus.cxf.client."myClient".features = #prettyLoggingFeature
----

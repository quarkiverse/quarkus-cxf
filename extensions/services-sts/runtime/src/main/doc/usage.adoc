Here are the key parts of a basic WS-Trust scenario:

* *WS-SecurityPolicy* - except for defining security requirements, such as transport protocols, encryption and signing,
  it can also contain an `<IssuedToken>` assertion.
  It specifies the requirements and constraints for these security tokens that the client must adhere to when accessing the service.
* *Security Token Service (STS)* - issues, validates, and renews security tokens upon request.
  It acts as a trusted authority that authenticates clients and issues tokens that assert the client's identity and permissions.
* *Client* - requests a token from the STS to access a web service.
  It must authenticate itself to the STS and provide details about the kind of token required.
* *Service* - relies on the STS to authenticate clients and validate their tokens.

=== Runnable example

There is an https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust[integration test]
covering WS-Trust in the {quarkus-cxf-project-name} source tree.
Let's walk through it and see how the individual parts are set to work together.

==== WS-SecurityPolicy

The policy is located in `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/resources/asymmetric-saml2-policy.xml[asymmetric-saml2-policy.xml]` file.
Its key part is the `<IssuedToken>` assertion requiring a SAML 2.0 token:

.asymmetric-saml2-policy.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$ws-trust/asymmetric-saml2-policy.xml[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-policy]
----

==== Security Token Service (STS)

The STS is implemented in `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/java/io/quarkiverse/cxf/it/ws/trust/sts/Sts.java[Sts.java]`:

.Sts.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$ws-trust/Sts.java[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-sts]
----

and configured in `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]`:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$ws-trust/application.properties[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-sts-properties]
----

==== Service

The service is implemented in `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/java/io/quarkiverse/cxf/it/ws/trust/server/TrustHelloServiceImpl.java[TrustHelloServiceImpl.java]`:

.TrustHelloServiceImpl.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$ws-trust/TrustHelloServiceImpl.java[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-service]
----

The `asymmetric-saml2-policy.xml` mentioned above is set in the Service Endpoint Interface `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/java/io/quarkiverse/cxf/it/ws/trust/server/TrustHelloService.java[TrustHelloService.java]`:

.TrustHelloServiceImpl.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$ws-trust/TrustHelloService.java[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-service]
----

The service endpoint is configured in `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]`:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$ws-trust/application.properties[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-service-properties]
----

==== Client

Finally, for the SOAP client to be able to communicate with the service, its `STSClient` needs to be configured.
It can be done in `https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]`:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$ws-trust/application.properties[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-client-properties]
----

[TIP]
====
The properties for configuring the STS client are provided by the `io.quarkiverse.cxf:quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security`
extension and documented on its
xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security.adoc#quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security_quarkus-cxf-client-clients-security-sts-client[reference page].
====

Alternatively, the client can be set as a bean reference:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$ws-trust/application.properties[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-client-bean]
----

In that case, the `@Named` bean needs to be produced programmatically, e.g. using `@jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces`:

.BeanProducers.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$ws-trust/BeanProducers.java[tag=ws-trust-usage.adoc-sts-client]
----

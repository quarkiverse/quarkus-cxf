[[endpoints-and-paths]]
= Service endpoints and paths

Let's explain how a service endpoint can be exposed under a certain URL path.

[[application-properties]]
== Set the endpoint path via `application.properties`

In the xref:user-guide/first-soap-web-service.adoc[First SOAP Web service] chapter, we explained how to expose a service using `application.properties`:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$soap-service/application.properties[tag=first-web-service.adoc]
----

With this setup in place, the `io.quarkiverse.cxf.it.server.HelloServiceImpl` will be accessible under `http://localhost:8080/soap/hello`.

This is the traditional way that worked since the very beginning of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}.

[[cxfendpoint-annotation]]
== Set the endpoint path using `@CXFEndpoint` annotation

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, there is a new way to expose an endpoint under a specific path: the `@io.quarkiverse.cxf.annotation.CXFEndpoint` annotation.
The path is set through its non-optional attribute `value`
and it is relative to `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-path[quarkus.cxf.path]`
much like when this is done via `application.properties`.

Let's have a look at an example.

[NOTE]
====
The sample code snippet shown in this section comes from the
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/client-server[Client and server integration test]
in the source tree of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}. You may want to use it as a runnable example.
====

.PathAnnotationHelloServiceImpl.java
[source,properties]
----
include::example$client-server/PathAnnotationHelloServiceImpl.java[]
----

<1> If the value of `quarkus.cxf.path` in `application.properties` is `/soap`,
    then this service will be accessible under `http://localhost:8080/soap/path-annotation`.

`@CXFEndpoint("/my-path")` annotation on `MyServiceImpl` type is equivalent to the `quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/my-path".implementor = org.acme.MyServiceImpl` line in `application.properties`.
Therefore it is enough to use just one of them.

Other options set in `application.properties` for the `/my-path` endpoint will combine just fine with `@CXFEndpoint("/my-path")`.

=== Use the `@CXFEndpoint` annotation on producer methods

The `@CXFEndpoint` annotation can also be used on producer methods.
This comes in handy especially when testing clients, because the returned implementation can be a mock.

Here is an example:

.MockedEndpointTest.java
[source,properties]
----
include::example$client-server/MockedEndpointTest.java[]
----

<1> Here we use the `@CXFEndpoint` annotation on a method that returns a mock of the `HelloService` interface.
    The `@jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces` annotation is not required, because {quarkus-cxf-project-name}
    declares `@CXFEndpoint` as a bean defining annotation.
<2> The client is configured in `application.properties` to connect to `http://localhost:8080/soap/helloMock`
<3> The assertion makes sure that the service implementation works as expected.

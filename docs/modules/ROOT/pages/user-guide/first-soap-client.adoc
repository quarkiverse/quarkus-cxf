= Your first SOAP Client on Quarkus

In this guide we explain how to create a simple Quarkus application acting as a client of a remote Web service.

== Remote Web service for testing

First, we need some remote Web service to connect to.
We can use a simple https://github.com/l2x6/calculator-ws[Calculator Web service] running in a container for that purpose.

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run -p 8082:8080 quay.io/l2x6/calculator-ws:1.0
----

Once the container is up and running, we can inspect its http://localhost:8082/calculator-ws/CalculatorService?wsdl[WSDL]

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -s http://localhost:8082/calculator-ws/CalculatorService?wsdl
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<wsdl:definitions xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:wsdl="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" xmlns:tns="http://www.jboss.org/eap/quickstarts/wscalculator/Calculator" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/" xmlns:ns1="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" name="CalculatorService" targetNamespace="http://www.jboss.org/eap/quickstarts/wscalculator/Calculator">

  ...

  <wsdl:binding name="CalculatorServiceSoapBinding" type="tns:CalculatorService">
    <soap:binding style="document" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http"></soap:binding>
    <wsdl:operation name="add">
      <soap:operation soapAction="" style="document"></soap:operation>
      <wsdl:input name="add">
        <soap:body use="literal"></soap:body>
      </wsdl:input>
      <wsdl:output name="addResponse">
        <soap:body use="literal"></soap:body>
      </wsdl:output>
    </wsdl:operation>
    <wsdl:operation name="subtract">
      <soap:operation soapAction="" style="document"></soap:operation>
      <wsdl:input name="subtract">
        <soap:body use="literal"></soap:body>
      </wsdl:input>
      <wsdl:output name="subtractResponse">
        <soap:body use="literal"></soap:body>
      </wsdl:output>
    </wsdl:operation>

    ...

  </wsdl:binding>

  ...

</wsdl:definitions>
----

As you can see in the WSDL, the service offers some basic arithmetic operations, such as `add`, `subtract`, etc.

Let's test it with `curl`:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -s \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8" \
    -d \
        '<Envelope xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
            <Body>
                <add xmlns="http://www.jboss.org/eap/quickstarts/wscalculator/Calculator">
                    <arg0 xmlns="">7</arg0> # <1>
                    <arg1 xmlns="">4</arg1>
                </add>
            </Body>
        </Envelope>' \
    http://localhost:8082/calculator-ws/CalculatorService
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <ns2:addResponse xmlns:ns2="http://www.jboss.org/eap/quickstarts/wscalculator/Calculator">
      <return>11</return> # <2>
    </ns2:addResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
----

<1> The request to add `7` and `4`
<2> `11` - return value of the operation

== SOAP client

Now let's have a look how we can get the client inside a Quarkus application.

First, we need the Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) and all other model classes it requires.

There are several ways to get them:

* Write by hand
* Copy from the Web Sevice project, if it is written in Java
* Have a Maven artifact containing the model classes, perhaps it is offered by the Service project
* Generate the model classes from WSDL

The last option tends to be the easiest and most flexible for client applications.

[[wsdl2java]]
TIP: If you want to use this approach, please first follow the xref:user-guide/generate-java-from-wsdl.adoc[Generate Java from WSDL] section and then continue with the next steps.

== Using SEI as a client

In our case, the Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) is `org.jboss.eap.quickstarts.wscalculator.calculator.CalculatorService`.

As usual on Quarkus, we can obtain an instance of it via CDI.

To make it testable easily, we'll wrap it in a REST service:

.CxfClientResource.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$calculator-client/CxfClientRestResource.java[]
----

<1> Let the CDI container inject an instance of the client. `@CXFClient("myCalculator")` is actually equivalent to `@Inject @CXFClient("myCalculator")`
<2> Invoke the `add` operation thus calling the remote Web service

Is this all we need for the client to work?
- No, in addition to the above, we need to tell a few other things to the CXF Quarkus extension in `application.properties`:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
cxf.it.calculator.baseUri=http://localhost:8082
include::example$calculator-client/application.properties[tag=first-soap-client.adoc]
----

TIP: All client configuration properties are documented in the xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#_configuration[Configuration properties] reference.

With all the above files in place, we should be able to start the application in Quarkus https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#dev-mode[`dev` mode]

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev
...
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) ... Listening on: http://localhost:8080
----

and test it by sending some requests to it:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/cxf/calculator-client/add?a=5&b=6'
11
----

where `11` is the correct result of adding `5` and `6`.

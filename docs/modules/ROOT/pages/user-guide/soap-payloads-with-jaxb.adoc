= Complex SOAP payloads with JAXB

Our introductory guides for Quarkus xref:user-guide/first-soap-client.adoc[SOAP client]
and xref:user-guide/first-soap-web-service.adoc[SOAP service] dealt with services
having only primitive parameters and return values such as integers and strings.
Let's have a look at passing and receiving more complex objects.

As an example, let's create an application for managing fruits.

[NOTE]
====
The sample code snippets used in this section come from the
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/server[server integration test]
in the source tree of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}
====

Because our representation of fruit is supposed to be a complex, let's model it as a Java bean with a couple of attributes:

[source,java]
----
include::example$soap-service/Fruit.java[]
----

As you may have noticed, we have used some https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/index.html[JAXB] annotations,
such as `@XmlElement`, `@XmlRootElement` and `@XmlType`.
This is to control the serialization and deserialization of the bean from and to XML.

== Automatic registration for reflection

JAXB is a reflection based serialization framework.
When learning about GraalVM native images, one of the first things you typically hear is
that you have to register classes, fields and methods for reflection at build time.
With plain GraalVM you'd have to do this through `reflection-config.json` manually.
Well, at least for the classes you have written yourself.
Not so with Quarkus. `quarkus-jaxb` extension (which `quarkus-cxf` depends on)
is able to scan your application's class path for classes annotated with JAXB annotations
and register them for reflection automatically.

Hence working with complex payloads on Quarkus is not different from stock CXF.
The JAXB serialization and deserialization will work out of the box without any additional configuration.

== SEI and implementation

The Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) for managing fruits might look like the following:

[source,java]
----
include::example$soap-service/FruitService.java[]
----

We can implement the SEI as simply as possible:

[source,java]
----
include::example$soap-service/FruitServiceImpl.java[]
----

== `application.properties`

The implementation is pretty straightforward and you just need to define your endpoints using the `application.properties`.

[source,properties]
----
include::example$soap-service/application.properties[tag=soap-payloads-with-jaxb.adoc]
----

== Test with Quarkus `dev` mode and `curl`

Having the above files in place, you can start Quarkus tooling in {link-quarkus-docs-base}/maven-tooling#dev-mode[`dev` mode]:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev
...
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) ... Listening on: http://localhost:8080
----

and then check whether the service is working by invoking its `list` operation:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8" \
    -d \
      '<soapenv:Envelope
      xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
      xmlns:ns1="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
        <soapenv:Body>
            <ns1:list/>
        </soapenv:Body>
    </soapenv:Envelope>' \
    http://localhost:8080/soap/fruits
...
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <ns1:listResponse xmlns:ns1="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
      <return xmlns:ns2="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
        <description>Winter fruit</description>
        <name>Apple</name>
      </return>
      <return xmlns:ns2="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
        <description>Tropical fruit</description>
        <name>Pineapple</name>
      </return>
    </ns1:listResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
----

As you can see, the endpoint has returned the two fruits `Apple` and `Pineapple` available by default.

Now let's add another fruit, say an `Orange`:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8" \
    -d \
     '<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
        <soap:Body>
          <ns2:add xmlns:ns2="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
            <arg0>
              <description>Mediterranean fruit</description>
              <name>Orange</name>
            </arg0>
          </ns2:add>
       </soap:Body></soap:Envelope>' \
    http://localhost:8080/soap/fruits
...
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <ns1:addResponse xmlns:ns1="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
      <return xmlns:ns2="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
        <description>Winter fruit</description>
        <name>Apple</name>
      </return>
      <return xmlns:ns2="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
        <description>Tropical fruit</description>
        <name>Pineapple</name>
      </return>
      <return xmlns:ns2="http://server.it.cxf.quarkiverse.io/">
        <description>Mediterranean fruit</description>
        <name>Orange</name>
      </return>
    </ns1:addResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
----

We can see `Orange` having been added in the returned list as expected.

[[configuration]]
= Configuration

{quarkus-cxf-project-name} exposes a large number of configuration options.
Each extension documents its options at the bottom of its xref:reference/index.adoc[reference page].

The configuration options can be set in `application.properties` file or via environment variables - see
{link-quarkus-docs-base}/config-reference[Quarkus configuration reference] for details.

[[beanRefs]]
== Bean references

Several configuration options of {quarkus-cxf-project-name} allow referring to beans present in Quarkus CDI container.
xref:user-guide/interceptors-features-handlers/cxf-interceptors-and-features.adoc[Features and interceptors] are typical examples of those.

There are two ways how to set a bean reference in the configuration: by type or by bean name.


=== Bean reference by type

Here is an example:

.application.properties
[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
# bean reference by type
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/hello".features = org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature
----

When using a reference by type name, the resolution proceeds as follows:

* Fist the bean is looked up in Quarkus CDI container by type.
* If the bean is available, it is used.
* If multiple beans assignable to the given type, then an exception is thrown.
* If no matching bean is available, then the class is loaded and an attempt is performed to instantiate it using its default constructor.

=== Bean reference by bean name

Here is an example:

.application.properties
[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
# bean reference by bean name
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/fruit".features = #myCustomLoggingFeature
----

When using a reference by bean name, then unsurprisingly, the bean is looked up in Quarkus CDI container by name.
A named bean called `myCustomLoggingFeature` can be defined as follows:

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
import org.apache.cxf.ext.logging.LoggingFeature;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;

class Producers {

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    @Named("myCustomLoggingFeature")
    LoggingFeature myCustomLoggingFeature() {
        LoggingFeature loggingFeature = new LoggingFeature();
        loggingFeature.setPrettyLogging(true);
        return loggingFeature;
    }
}
----

= Generate WSDL document from Java

If the WSDL served by your service at http://your-host/your-service?wsdl is not enough
because you e.g. want to distribute it as a Maven artifact,
then you can use `java2ws` to generate the WSDL document at build time.

You do not need to invoke the `java2ws` tool provided by CXF directly,
neither you have to use the `cxf-java2ws-plugin`.

`quarkus-cxf` wraps `java2ws` and so you can configure it in `application.properties`
as any other aspect of your application.

Here is an example:

[NOTE]
====
The sample code snippets used in this section come from the
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/server[server integration test]
in the source tree of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}
====

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$soap-service/application.properties[tag=generate-wsdl-from-java.adoc]
----

Here we have instructed `java2ws` to generate WSDLs for two interfaces,
namely `HelloService` and `FaultyHelloService`.

[NOTE]
.Annotations
====
Note that the Service interfaces must be annotated with `{javaxOrJakartaPackagePrefix}.xml.ws.WebService` to be selected for `java2ws` processing.
====

The two generated WSDL documents will be stored as `target/Java2wsTest/FaultyHelloService-from-java2ws.wsdl`
and `target/Java2wsTest/HelloService-from-java2ws.wsdl` respectively.

NOTE: Unlike `wsdl2java` which is executed within Quarkus source generation phase,
      `java2ws` is a part Quarkus augmentation that happens after compilation.
      The input of `java2ws` are, after all, Java class files.
      Hence you do not need to add `<goal>generate-code</goal>` to `quarkus-maven-plugin`
      for `java2ws`.

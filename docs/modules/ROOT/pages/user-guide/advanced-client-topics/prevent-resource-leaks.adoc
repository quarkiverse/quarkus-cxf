CXF client proxies implement `java.io.Closeable`.
Therefore, it is important to call `((Closeable) proxy).close()` once the client is not needed anymore
to free all associated system resources, such as threads.

{quarkus-cxf-project-name} takes care for closing the clients injected via `@io.quarkiverse.cxf.annotation.CXFClient` automatically
as soon as they are disposed by the CDI container.

For client proxies created manually, it is up to you to call `((Closeable) proxy).close()`:

[source,java]

import java.net.URL;
import javax.xml.namespace.QName;
import jakarta.xml.ws.Service;
import java.io.Closeable;

final URL serviceUrl = new URL("http://localhost/myService?wsdl");
final QName qName = new QName("http://acme.org/myNamespace", "MyService");
final Service service = jakarta.xml.ws.Service.create(serviceUrl, qName);
final MyService proxy = service.getPort(MyService.class);

try {
    proxy.doSomething();
} finally {
    ((Closeable) proxy).close();
}

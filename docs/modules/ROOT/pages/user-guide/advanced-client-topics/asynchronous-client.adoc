== Synchronous vs. asynchronous client calls

When calling a SOAP client _synchronously_, the service method returns
only after the whole response from the remote service is received and parsed.
The result of the operation is passed as the return value to the caller:

[source,java]
----
@CXFClient("hello")
HelloService hello;

void callHello() {
    // Synchronous CXF client call
    String result = hello.hello("Joe");
    Log.info(result); // prints "Hello Joe"
}
----

When calling the client _asynchronously_, the service method may terminate
before the response from the remote service was received.
The result of the operation is passed either through a future object
or through a callback.

Here is an example:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

@CXFClient("hello")
HelloService hello;

void callHelloAsyncWithFuture() {
    Future<HelloResponse> future = hello.helloAsync("Joe");
    Log.info(future.isDone()); // may print true or false
    // the get() method will block until the response is ready
    HelloResponse response = future.get();
    Log.info(response.getResult()); // prints "Hello Joe"
}

void callHelloAsyncWithCallback() {
    hello.helloAsync("Joe", response -> {
        // this callback method is invoked when the response is ready
        Log.info(response.get().getResult()); // prints "Hello Joe"
    });
}
----

== The `*Async()` methods

You may ask yourself where do those `helloAsync(...)` methods in the above example come from?

They are specified by the JAX-WS 2.0 standard
and their use is supported by {quarkus-cxf-project-name} since version 1.1.0.

The `*Async()` methods can either be crafted manually
or they can be xref:user-guide/advanced-client-topics/asynchronous-client.adoc#asynchronous-client-generate-async-methods[generated from WSDL by `wsdl2java`]
for you, in case you do xref:user-guide/contract-first-code-first.adoc[Contract first] development.

There are two flavors of those methods:

1. `java.util.concurrent.Future`-based where the availability of the result needs to be polled

2. Callback-based, where the callback is notified once the result or failure is available.

Let's have a look at an example.

[[future-based-asynchronous-method]]
=== `java.util.concurrent.Future`-based asynchronous method

Given the synchronous method signature

[source,java]
----
@WebMethod
@ResponseWrapper(
    localName = "helloResponse",
    targetNamespace = "http://acme.org/",
    className = "org.acme.HelloResponse")
@WebResult(name = "return", targetNamespace = "")
public String hello(String person);
----

its `Future`-based asynchronous companion would be

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.xml.ws.Response;

@WebMethod(operationName = "hello")
@ResponseWrapper(
    localName = "helloResponse",
    targetNamespace = "http://acme.org/",
    className = "org.acme.HelloResponse")
public Response<org.acme.HelloResponse> helloAsync(String person);
----

where `jakarta.xml.ws.Response` (extending `java.util.concurrent.Future`) represents the result of the asynchronous operation
that is either available immediately
or it will become available at some point in the future.
The `isDone()` method of `java.util.concurrent.Future` can be used for polling the state of the execution,
whereas the `get()` and `get(long timeout, TimeUnit timeUnit)` methods block until the result is available.

Polling for some I/O dependent state or blocking calls in general are not especially useful in the context of Quarkus and its reactive Vert.x core.
Blocking the Vert.x Event Loop is forbidden, while dispatching the blocking call to a worker thread would not be very performant.
Luckily, there is the other, callback-based flavor of asynchronous SEI methods.

[[callback-based-asynchronous-method]]
=== Callback-based asynchronous method (preferred)

For the above `String hello(String person)` method, its callback-based asynchronous pendant would be

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.xml.ws.AsyncHandler;

@WebMethod(operationName = "hello")
@ResponseWrapper(
    localName = "helloResponse",
    targetNamespace = "http://acme.org/",
    className = "org.acme.HelloResponse")
public Future<?> helloAsync(
        String person,
        AsyncHandler<org.acme.HelloResponse> asyncHandler);
----

where `AsyncHandler` is the callback that will be called when the execution succeeds or fails.

This style of communication is much easier to reconcile with Quarkus reactive core.
For example, to wrap a call of
`helloAsync(String person, AsyncHandler<HelloResponse> asyncHandler)`
in a `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni` you can leverage the
`toUni()` utility method provided by {quarkus-cxf-project-name}.
For example, the resulting `Uni` can be used as a return value of a reactive REST handler method:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.ws.rs.POST;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.quarkiverse.cxf.mutiny.CxfMutinyUtils;

@Path("/rest")
class HelloRest {

    @CXFClient("hello")
    HelloService hello;

    @Path("/hello")
    @POST
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    Uni<String> helloWithWsdl(String person) {
        return CxfMutinyUtils
            .<HelloResponse> toUni(handler -> helloService.helloAsync(person, handler))
            .map(HelloResponse::getReturn);
    }
}
----

[id="asynchronous-client-generate-async-methods"]
== Generate async methods

Asynchronous client invocations require some additional methods in the service endpoint interface which are not generated by default.

To enable it, you need to create a JAX-WS binding file with `enableAsyncMapping` set to `true`:

[TIP]
====
The sample code snippets used in this section come from the
{link-quarkus-cxf-source-tree-base}/integration-tests/metrics[Metrics integration test]
in the source tree of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}
====

.src/main/resources/wsdl/async-binding.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$metrics/async-binding.xml[]
----

This file should then be passed to xref:user-guide/contract-first-code-first/generate-java-from-wsdl.adoc[wsdl2java]
through its xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-codegen-wsdl2java-additional-params[additional-params] property:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$metrics/application.properties[tag=async-client.wsdl2java]
----

== Caller threads and callback threads

As mentioned above, you should prefer using the
xref:user-guide/advanced-client-topics/asynchronous-client.adoc#callback-based-asynchronous-method[callback based asynchronous client methods].
You can call those on any thread, including Vert.x Event Loop threads.
Internally, the client call is always dispatched on a worker thread.
This is due to technical limitations of the CXF client API
and also because there is no guarantee that all parts of the CXF interceptor chain will avoid performing blocking operations.

The asynchronous callback is notified on a worker thread except the situation
when dispatching the call to a worker thread timeouts due to Worker Thread Pool exhaustion - see the next section.

=== Measures to prevent Worker Thread Pool contention

In case the application is under high load, it may take every long time
till there is a worker thread available for executing the client call.

There are some configuration options you may want to adjust to prevent that:

* `https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config#quarkus-core_quarkus-thread-pool-core-threads[quarkus.thread-pool.core-threads]`
* `https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config#quarkus-core_quarkus-thread-pool-max-threads[quarkus.thread-pool.max-threads]`
* `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-client-worker-dispatch-timeout[quarkus.cxf.client.worker-dispatch-timeout]`

== Historical note

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.17.0, the asynchronous mode is supported by `VertxHttpClientHTTPConduit` provided via the
`xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc[io.quarkiverse.cxf:quarkus-cxf]` extension.

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.17.0, the asynchronous use case was only supported via
`io.quarkiverse.cxf:quarkus-cxf-rt-transports-http-hc5` which was removed in {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.22.0.

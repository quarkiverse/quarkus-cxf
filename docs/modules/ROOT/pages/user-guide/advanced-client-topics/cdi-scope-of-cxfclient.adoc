[[cdi-scope-of-cxfclient]]
= CDI scope of clients injected via `@CXFClient`

{quarkus-cxf-project-name} produces all clients injected via `@io.quarkiverse.cxf.annotation.CXFClient` in the default `@Dependent` scope.
Due to that, the real scope of the injected instance depends on the CDI scope of the bean into which the client is injected.

Therefore, if the client is injected into an `@ApplicationScoped` bean, then the client instance also becomes `@ApplicationScoped`.
If the client is injected into an `@RequestScoped` bean, then the client instance also becomes `@RequestScoped`.

This behavior comes in handy if you need to

after the application was started.

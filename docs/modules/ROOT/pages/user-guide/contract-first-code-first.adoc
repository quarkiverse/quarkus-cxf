= Contract first and code first approaches

Both contract first and code first development modes are fully supported by {quarkus-cxf-project-name}.

== Contract first client

A SOAP service is described by WSDL.
It is a contract defining operations, their parameters and return values, etc.
WSDL is rich enough to be used for generating the code of a complete client.
CXF provides the `wsdl2java` utility for that.

{quarkus-cxf-project-name} wraps `wsdl2java` in the `quarkus-cxf` extension so you do not need to use it directly.

Follow the xref:user-guide/generate-java-from-wsdl.adoc[Generate the Model classes from WSDL] section of the user guide
for more details about how to use it.

You may also want to check the CXF https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-consumer.html[Developing a Consumer] as a general introduction.

== Contract first service

When implementing a service the xref:user-guide/generate-java-from-wsdl.adoc[generation of Java code from WSDL]
may also come in handy.
`wsdl2java` can generate the model classes (with JAXB annotations)
and service interfaces (with JAX-WS annotations) for you.
Your task is then to provide implementations for those interfaces.

You may want to check the https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-service.html#DevelopingaService-WSDLFirstDevelopment[WSDL First Service Development]
section of CXF documentation for a better understanding of the underlying concepts.

== Code first service

Another valid option at your disposal is to write your service in Java, using JAX-WS and JAXB.
Then you have two options how to obtain the WSDL contract:

1. Start your service and point your clients at http://your-host/your-service?wsdl
2. xref:user-guide/contract-first-code-first.adoc[Generate the WSDL document from Java] classes at build time

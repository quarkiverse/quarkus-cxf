= Package for running on a JVM or natively

In this chapter, we explain how to package a Quarkus CXF application for running on a JVM or for running it natively.

[[jvm-mode]]
== JVM mode

In the introductory guides for SOAP client and SOAP service, we worked only in Quarkus `dev` mode:
Quarkus tooling was running on the background,
watching for changes in our workspace, recompiling and reloading the application as needed.

How do we run the application on a JVM once we are done with the development?

First we need to package it with Maven:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn package
----

The libraries needed to run the application on a JVM can be found in `target/quarkus-app` directory:

[source,shell]
----
$ ls -lh target/quarkus-app
drwxr-xr-x. 2 ppalaga ppalaga 4.0K Jan 12 22:29 app
drwxr-xr-x. 4 ppalaga ppalaga 4.0K Jan 12 22:29 lib
drwxr-xr-x. 2 ppalaga ppalaga 4.0K Jan 12 22:29 quarkus
-rw-r-r--. 1 ppalaga ppalaga 6.1K Jan 12 22:29 quarkus-app-dependencies.txt
-rw-r-r--. 1 ppalaga ppalaga  678 Jan 12 22:29 quarkus-run.jar
----

We can start the application as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

You can send some SOAP requests using `curl` to make sure that the application works.

[[native]]
== Native mode

Quarkus offers first class support for building GraalVM native images
and {quarkus-cxf-project-name} fully honors that promise too.

[NOTE]
.Images
====
GraalVM native images are platform specific executable files that you can run directly without a JVM.
They boot faster and spend less memory compared to running the same application in JVM mode.
====

The `pom.xml` file generated by https://{link-quarkus-code-generator}[{link-quarkus-code-generator}]
contains the `native` profile needed for building the native image:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
  <id>native</id>
  <activation>
    <property>
      <name>native</name>
    </property>
  </activation>
  <properties>
    <skipITs>false</skipITs>
    <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>
  </properties>
</profile>
----

Further, as mentioned xref:#_prerequisites[above], you need the GraalVM `native-image` tool.

You should either have it installed locally and have `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable set properly,
or -- if you only need to produce a Linux native executable -- you can use `docker`.

.With local installation of GraalVM
[source,shell]
----
# Make sure $GRAALVM_HOME is set properly
$ echo $GRAALVM_HOME
/home/{user}/.sdkman/candidates/java/{major}.{minor}.r{java-version}-grl

# Produce the native executable
mvn package -Pnative
----

TIP: Quarkus is quite picky about the GraalVM version.
    When using the local installation, always make sure that you use the version preferred by Quarkus.
    You can do that by opening `quarkus-bom` imported in your `pom.xml` and searching for `graalvm` there.
    If you use Docker, Quarkus takes care for pulling the right version for you.

.With `docker`
[source,shell]
----
# Produce the native executable
mvn package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

This can take a minute or so for a simple application.

When the build is done, the native executable should be available in `target` directory:

[source,shell]
----
$ ls -l target
...
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 ppalaga ppalaga  71M Jan 11 22:42 quarkus-cxf-integration-test-server-1.8.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
...
----

As you can see, it has a size of only 71 MB, and is executable.

You can run it as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ target/*-runner
...
INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) quarkus-cxf-integration-test-server 1.8.0-SNAPSHOT native (powered by Quarkus
2.15.2.Final) started in 0.042s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
...
----

Again, you can send some SOAP requests using `curl` to make sure that the native executable works.

Do not forget to compare the memory usage, time to first request and other performance metrics
with the stack you used before and share your results!

[[cxf-extension-for-quarkus]]
= {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

This project aims at porting http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] to https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] runtime
including full support for producing https://quarkus.io/container-first/[GraalVM native images].

[IMPORTANT]
While http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] implements wide range of standards and specifications,
{quarkus-cxf-project-name} is currently focusing *only* on supporting the ones related to
*Simple Object Access Protocol* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP[SOAP])
and *Java API for XML Web Services* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAX-WS[JAX-WS]).
Refer to xref:reference/index.adoc[Reference] to learn which parts of CXF are supported.

The documentation is divided in two major parts:

* xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] - explains the typical usage of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}
* xref:reference/index.adoc[Reference] - the full list of supported specifications, use cases and configuration options

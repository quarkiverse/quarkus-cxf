= {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.20.1 release notes

== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1776[#1776] Backport adding `io.quarkiverse.cxf.CxfTlsConfiguration.getName()`

There was a backwards incompatible change in Quarkus 3.21.1,
because of which we had to release {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.21.1.
Quarkus team announced that they plan to backport that change to their 3.20 LTS stream too.
By backporting the fix to our 3.20 stream, we prepare for that incompatibility in advance.

= {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.13.1 release notes

== Important dependency upgrades

* CXF 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5 - https://cxf.apache.org/download.html[release notes], link:https://github.com/apache/cxf/compare/cxf-4.0.4+++...+++cxf-4.0.5[changelog]

== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1455[#1455] Vert.x HTTP client is incorrectly used as the default

We introduced xref:release-notes/3.13.0.adoc#vert-x-httpclient-based-http-conduit[Vert.x HttpClient based HTTP Conduit] in {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.13.0
and it was not supposed to replace the original `HttpURLConnection` based default conduit.
However, we screwed the default handling which resulted in using `VertxHttpClientHTTPConduit` as a default in some cases.
This was fixed in {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.13.1.
`HttpURLConnection` based conduit is now used as a default in all situations as it was the case before 3.13.0.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.

=== Documentation improvements

* We added a paragraph explaining xref:user-guide/create-project.adoc#quarkus-platform[Quarkus Platform]
* We added the xref:release-planning.adoc[Release planning] page explaining how and when we release {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== Logging extension is deprecated

The Logging functionality and all associated
xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-logging-enabled-for[configuration options] were moved to `io.quarkiverse.cxf:quarkus-cxf` extension.
The `io.quarkiverse.cxf:quarkus-cxf-rt-features-logging` extension is now deprecated and you can remove it from your projects.
It will be removed altogether in the future.

=== `quarkus.cxf.http-conduit-factory` fixed

See https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1047[#1047]

=== Configurable destination folder of `wsdl2java`

The directory where the xref:user-guide/contract-first-code-first/generate-java-from-wsdl.adoc[`wsdl2java` embedded in `quarkus-cxf`] extension produces the Java classes is now configurable
via the `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf#quarkus-cxf_quarkus.cxf.codegen.wsdl2java.output-directory[quarkus.cxf.codegen.wsdl2java.output-directory]` property.

=== Possible thread leaks with CXF clients using `java.net.http.HttpClient`

[NOTE]
====
This issue was originally reported as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-8885[CXF-8885].
====

CXF client proxies implement `java.io.Closeable`.
Therefore, it is important to call `((Closeable) proxy).close()` once the client is not needed anymore
to free all associated system resources, such as threads.

{quarkus-cxf-project-name} now takes care for closing the clients injected via `@io.quarkiverse.cxf.annotation.CXFClient` automatically
as soon as they are disposed by the CDI container.

For client proxies created manually, it is up to you to call `((Closeable) proxy).close()`.

For more information, see xref:user-guide/advanced-client-topics/prevent-resource-leaks.adoc[Prevent resource leaks] section of the user guide.

=== Large responses not written slowly anymore

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 2.6.0, large responses were written slowly due to allocating too small buffers.
This https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1066[issue] is now fixed.


=== More WS-Security configuration options covered by tests

We are continually improving the test coverage of the xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security.adoc#quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security-configuration[WS-Security configuration options].
There is now less options marked with the warning

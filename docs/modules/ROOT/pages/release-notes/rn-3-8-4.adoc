= {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.8.4 (LTS) release notes

== Important dependency upgrades:

* Quarkus 3.8.3 -> 3.8.4 - https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-8-4-released/[release notes]

== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== Sevice methods with the same name in the same Java package

If there are two SEIs in one Java package, both having a `@WebMethod` with the same name but different signature,
then the default name for the ASM-generated request, response and possibly other classes is the same for both methods of both classes.

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.10.0 and 3.8.4, no exception was thrown when this happened during the class generation.
At runtime, only one set of those classes was present and calls to one of the clients failed inevitably.

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.10.0 and 3.8.4, the problem is detected at build time and the build fails.

This was reported as issue https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1326[#1326].
We filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-9003[CXF-9003] to see whether a proper solution is possible in CXF.

=== Interceptors set through `@InInterceptors` and similar annotations are now looked up in the CDI container

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0 and 3.8.4, xref:user-guide/interceptors-features-handlers/cxf-interceptors-and-features.adoc[interceptors] specified through `@InInterceptors`, `@InFaultInterceptors`, `@OutInterceptors` and `@OutFaultInterceptors` annotations from `org.apache.cxf.interceptor` package
were only instantiated using reflection.
Due to this, injecting beans and configuration values into them did not work.

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0 and 3.8.4, those interceptors are looked up in the CDI container first
and reflexive instantiation is used only as a fallback.
Injecting other beans and configuration values into interceptor beans created by the CDI container will work flawlessly.

=== `@WebService(wsdlLocation="my-service.wsdl")` now honored

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0 and 3.8.4, when a web service implementation had an annotation like `@WebService(wsdlLocation="my-service.wsdl")`,
then only an auto-generated WSDL without policies and other important parts was served on `http://localhost:8080/services/foo?wsdl`
instead the local WSDL file.

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0 and 3.8.4, the `wsdlLocation` attribute of the `@WebService` annotation is honored properly.

This was originally reported as issue https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/557[#557].

=== Other minor changes

* Improved FIPS and OpenTelemetry related test coverage
* Typos and minor rewordings in the documentation
* Dependency management improvements

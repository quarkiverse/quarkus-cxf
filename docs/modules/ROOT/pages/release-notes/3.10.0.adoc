== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== Windows CI

We started testing every pull request on Windows.
Unfortunately, we have to skip all integration tests that require a container,
because GitHub Actions Windows workers do not allow running Linux containers yet.

=== In-App SmallRye Config SPI implementations work again

The bug https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1332[#1332] alias https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/[quarkus#39689]
got fixed in {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.10.0.

=== Sevice methods with the same name in the same Java package

If there are two SEIs in one Java package, both having a `@WebMethod` with the same name but different signature,
then the default name for the ASM-generated request, response and possibly other classes is the same for both methods of both classes.

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.10.0 and 3.8.4, no exception was thrown when this happened during the class generation.
At runtime, only one set of those classes was present and calls to one of the clients failed inevitably.

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.10.0 and 3.8.4, the problem is detected at build time and the build fails.

This was reported as issue https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1326[#1326].
We filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-9003[CXF-9003] to see whether a proper solution is possible in CXF.

=== Documentation Improvements

* All configuration properties are now tagged with the version of {quarkus-cxf-project-name} since which they exist.

* We added the xref:release-notes/index.adoc[Version table] to the Release notes page showing which version of
  {quarkus-cxf-project-name} uses which CXF version and which Quarkus Platform `<major>.<minor>` you should use
  to get the given {quarkus-cxf-project-name} version.

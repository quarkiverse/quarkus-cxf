= {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0 release notes

== Important dependency upgrades

* Quarkus 3.10.x -> 3.11.0 - https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-11-0-released/[release notes]

== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== `@CXFEndpoint("/my-service")` - a new annotation for specifying the service endpoint path

Since this {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, there is a new way to expose an endpoint under a specific path:
the `@io.quarkiverse.cxf.annotation.CXFEndpoint` annotation.
The path is set through its non-optional attribute `value` and it is relative to `quarkus.cxf.path` much like when this is done via `application.properties`.

Here is basic example:

[source,java]
----
@CXFEndpoint("/path-annotation")
@WebService(serviceName = "HelloService", targetNamespace = "https://acme.org/my-service")
public class HelloServiceImpl implements HelloService {
    @Override
    public String hello(String person) {
        ...
    }
}
----

You can read more about `@CXFEndpoint` in the new chapter of {quarkus-cxf-project-name} called xref:user-guide/endpoints-and-paths.adoc[Service endpoints and paths].

=== Interceptors set through `@InInterceptors` and similar annotations are now looked up in the CDI container

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, xref:user-guide/cxf-interceptors-and-features.adoc[interceptors] specified through `@InInterceptors`, `@InFaultInterceptors`, `@OutInterceptors` and `@OutFaultInterceptors` annotations from `org.apache.cxf.interceptor` package
were only instantiated using reflection.
Due to this, injecting beans and configuration values into them did not work.

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, those interceptors are looked up in the CDI container first
and reflexive instantiation is used only as a fallback.
Injecting other beans and configuration values into interceptor beans created by the CDI container will work flawlessly.

=== `@WebService(wsdlLocation="my-service.wsdl")` now honored

Before {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, when a web service implementation had an annotation like `@WebService(wsdlLocation="my-service.wsdl")`,
then only an auto-generated WSDL without policies and other important parts was served on `http://localhost:8080/services/foo?wsdl`
instead the local WSDL file.

Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, the `wsdlLocation` attribute of the `@WebService` annotation is honored properly.

This was originally reported as issue https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/557[#557].

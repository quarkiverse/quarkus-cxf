== New and noteworthy in {quarkus-cxf-project-name}

=== https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/1399[#1399] Beans not injected into a service impl with `@CXFEndpoint("/my-path")`

In {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.0, we added a new feature allowing to specify service endpoint paths through a new annotation `@CXFEndpoint("/myPath")`.
The new code did not work well for service implementation classes having both `@WebService` and `@CXFEndpoint` annotations.
In those cases, if the service had some `@Inject` fields, those fields were left blank and the service call has thrown a `NullPointerException`.
This issue was fixed in In {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.11.1.
